<title>Generated OCL Constraints</title>
<conbody><p>One of the primary purposes for creating a template model is to express constraints on the CDA model in an intuitive, structural way. The model-to-model transformation uses this logical representation to generate OCL constraints reducing the burdern on the developer to hand code OCL expressions.</p></conbody>
