		<p class="p">This implementation guide is generated from UML models developed in
			the Open Health Tools (OHT) Model-Driven Health Tools (MDHT) project.
			The HITSP specifications have been formalized into computational
			models expressed in UML. These models are used by automated tooling
			to generate this publication, plus validation tools and Java libraries
			for implementers.</p>

		<p class="p">This document combines specifications from several HITSP
			documents, as summarized in the following sections. For the authoritative
			source, please refer to the approved specifications from HITSP.</p>

		<div class="body">
			<p class="p">The HITSP Summary Documents Using HL7 Continuity of Care Document
				(CCD) Component describes the document content summarizing a
				consumer's medical status for the purpose of information exchange. The
				content may include administrative (e.g., registration, demographics,
				insurance, etc.) and clinical (problem list, medication list,
				allergies, test results, etc) information. Any specific use of this
				Component by another HITSP specification may constrain the content
				further based upon the requirements and context of the document
				exchange. This specification defines content in order to promote
				interoperability between participating systems. Any given system
				creating or consuming the document may contain much more information
				than conveyed by this specification. Such systems may include Personal
				Health Record Systems (.1.s), Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRs),
				Practice Management Applications and other persons and systems as
				identified and permitted.</p>

			<p class="p">This Component is essentially a subset of the healthcare data that
				has been developed for specific business Use Cases. This subset
				contains the minimum critical or pertinent medical information
				sections as specified by the business case. Information conveyed
				according to the Component Construct is a representative extract of
				the information available on the creating system. The information in
				the HITSP Summary Documents Using HL7 Continuity of Care Document
				(CCD) Component and the creating systems must be consistent.
				Furthermore there should be no data elsewhere in the creating
				systemthat would contradict the meaning of any data in this construct.
				The expectation is that consuming systems will be able to use this
				specification as a source of information to input and/or update
				information in their instantiation of the healthcare record. This
				specification does not define the policies applicable to the import of
				this information.</p>

			<p class="p">It is anticipated and desirable that some implementers of the HITSP
				Summary Documents Using HL7 Continuity of Care Document (CCD)
				Component will want to add data and sections to permit greater
				communication between systems. The underlying standards (primarily HL7
				CCD – Continuity of Care Document) have additional modules that may
				serve such purposes. This practice is beyond the scope of this HITSP
				Component. Implementers should be aware that they must assume that
				receivers of the document may only be able to view or process content
				modules as described in this specification, and may not be able to use
				the additional modules in the document. This means that the HITSP
				Summary Documents Using HL7 Continuity of Care Document (CCD)
				Component must be able to stand-alone. Applications may wish to
				display the document in two different user-selected views, one of
				which is restricted to the minimal dataset contents of this component.
				Adding optional sections and data elements should not generate errors.
				Optional data should be used if understood by the receiving system,
				but must not change the meaning of the document.</p>

			<p class="p">This Component refers to the HITSP 2008 work cycle. It expands upon
				the prior version of the specification for a consumer’s
				registration/medication history information to include content to
				support the consumer's access to clinical information, medication
				management activities and supportive information for quality of care
				assessment.</p>

		<h2 class="title topictitle2">C83 Content Modules</h2>

		<div class="body">
			<p class="p">The purpose of the Healthcare Information Technology Standards
				Panel (HITSP) CDA Content Modules Component is to define the library
				of Components that may be used by CDA-based constructs developed by
				HITSP and others in standards based exchanges. The Components are
				organized into modules to simplify navigation. These modules are
				organized along the same principals as the HL7 Continuity of Care
				Document.</p>

			<p class="p">The data elements found in these modules are based on HL7 CDA
				Implementation Guides and the IHE PCC Technical Framework Volume II,
				Release 5 and its related supplements. These guides contain
				specifications for document sections that are consistent with all
				clinical documents currently selected for HITSP constructs.</p>

	<div class="body">
		<p class="p">The purpose of the Health Information Technology Standards Panel
			(HITSP) Clinical Document and Message Terminology Component is to
			define the vocabulary for either document-based or message-based
			HITSP constructs such as Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)
			documents, HL7 V2 messages, etc. For more in-depth information about
			how this Component relates to other HITSP constructs, see HITSP/TN901
