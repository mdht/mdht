section often includes notable results such as abnormal values or relevant trends, and
could contain all results for the period of time being documented.
In some situations, such as in the emergency department and pending surgery,
diagnostic findings are not available when a History and Physical is released. As
explained in Section 4.1 Section Descriptions above, a required section for which no
content is available must contain some indication that no content is available.
Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in
areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology,
microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens
obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory.
Imaging results are typically generated by a clinician reviewing the output of an imaging
procedure, such as where a cardiologist reports the left ventricular ejection fraction
based on the review of a cardiac echocardiogram.
Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician wanting to provide more
granular information about component observations made during the performance of a
procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed
during a colonoscopy.</li></ul></li>

must be present if the document has been legally authenticated. Based on local
practice, clinical documents may be released before legal authentication. This implies
that a clinical document that does not contain this element has not been legally
authenticated.</p>
<p>The act of legal authentication requires a certain privilege be granted to the legal
authenticator depending upon local policy. All clinical documents have the potential for
legal authentication, given the appropriate credentials.</p>
<p>Local policies may choose to delegate the function of legal authentication to a device or
system that generates the clinical document. In these cases, the legal authenticator is
a person accepting responsibility for the document, not the generating device or system.</p></li></ul></li>
