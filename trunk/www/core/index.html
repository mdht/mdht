<p>This project provides a set of <strong>UML Core</strong>
components that support the model-driven&nbsp;analysis, design, and
implementation of healthcare standards and applications. A more detailed
description is available on our <a title="Project wiki"
	href="https://mdht.projects.openhealthtools.org/wiki/">project
wiki</a>, but examples of these foundation components include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A UML profile with stereotypes that extend models with HL7
	metadata</li>
	<li>Plug-ins and custom Ant tasks for importing and exporting HL7
	MIF representation from UML models</li>
	<li>Generation of XML Schemas from HL7 styled UML models</li>
	<li>Other components under development or part of future project
	plans...</li>
</ul>
<p>A separate project component is dedicated to development of <a
	title="CDA Tools component"
	href="/cda/index.html">CDA
Tools</a> that are built on these foundation components.</p>
<p>This project's title, <strong>mdht</strong>, emphasizes
that these tools are based on the Eclipse model-driven development tool stack,
extended with features required for healthcare standards and
applications. The Eclipse modeling tools and OMG modeling language dependencies are
shown in this figure:</p>
