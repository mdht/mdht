						software product. The plug-ins and modification of the Eclipse
						platform can later be distributed royalty free.</p>

			My Section and pointing to Clinical Care Document and Section are

			Implementation Guide. The same holds true for My Section which will
			inherit all constraints define in the CDA standard as it pertains to
			Section.</p>
			<p>The open arrow starting from My Document and pointing to My
			Section is an example of an UML association. Associations are used to
			define navigation and cardinality amongst UML classes. In this case,
			the association defines a relationship between My Document and My
			Section where My Document will contain 1 to n instances of My
			Section.</p>
