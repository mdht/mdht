Downloads</h1>

<p>All project builds are intended to be installed in your Eclipse
platform using the Eclipse Update Manager, accessed using the <b>Help
&gt; Software Updates...</b> menu. The update sites are currently located on
a SourceForge server where we have access to web file directories
(unavailable on the OHT server). The update sites contain release and
milestone builds, but not integration development builds. If you are
unfamiliar with use of the update manager:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add an update site location (<a href="images/AddSite.png">screen
	image</a>)</li>
	<li>Select features for installation (<a
		href="images/SelectInstall.png">screen image</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Install from one or both update sites URLs:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For CDA Tools: <strong>http://oht-modeling.sourceforge.net/cda/updates</strong></li>
	<li>For HDF Tools: <strong>http://oht-modeling.sourceforge.net/updates</strong>></li>
</ul>

<p>A ZIP of the update site is created for each build, which you can
download and configure as a local update site location in the Eclipse
update manager. This is useful for organizations that prohibit use of
external update sites via their firewall.</p>

contain pre-release software that is pending approval for redistribution

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> If you have ANY test build installed prior
to 1st July 2009, then you MUST uninstall it prior to using the update
site to install this release candidate. The Eclipse feature IDs have
changed. If you do not uninstall the prior features, then you will have
duplicate functionality where all menus, properties tabs, etc. will
appear twice. For guidance, see <a href="images/Uninstall.png">screen
image </a>showing selection and uninstall of previous build.</p>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Integration and Development Builds</h2>
<p>The following are integration / developmental builds and are not
formal releases. Each zip file is a complete Eclipse update site that
may be installed into your Eclipse workbench using the update manager.</p>
