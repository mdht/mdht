Completion of CCD constraints
-------------------------------------------
* First pass section completion (without conf IDs)
 - Document Header
 - Alerts
 - Problems
 - Results
 - Vitals Signs
 - Immunization
 
* Completion with conf IDs
 - through CONF-68
 
 
* Medications Section
 - completed CONF-298 thru CONF-333
 
 * Problems Section
 - TODO: Define value set for ProblemStatusCode, and ProblemHealthStatusCode
 - TODO: Finish OCL for PatientAwareness participantRoleId

 Issues
 ------------------------------------------
 * ProblemObservation: code SHALL be present, by MAY use specified value set.
 	-- need to separate these two constraints on a property
 * an association MAY be present, but if present SHALL have specific typeCode.
 	See MedicationActivity, rules 330 and 333
 
Conformance rules not included
-------------------------------------------
CONF-7: CCD SHALL contain one or more ClinicalDocument / templateId.
 * this could never fail in MDHT implementation

 
Publishing TODO
-------------------------------------------
* Appendix of defined templates, sorted by ID (as table)
	- also referenced templates
* Appendix of sorted Conf Rule IDs, with hyperlink to defining class
* Appendix of referenced vocabulary
* Table of section cardinality (see Cons Note, or as in HITSP)
*
