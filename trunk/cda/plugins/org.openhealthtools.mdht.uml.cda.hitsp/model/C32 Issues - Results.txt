
* C83 Diagnostic Results Section IS NOT derived from CCD Results Section (or any other CCD section)
	- This calls into question whether MU can be satisfied by using C83 Diagnostic Results; 
	  MU patient summary is supposed to be a CCD document.
	- Proposals:
		(1) Modify IHE Coded Results Section (parent of C83 section) to be derived from CCD Results
		(2) Or, use CCD Results Section without a HITSP templateId. Require use of C83 Result entry within section.

* If C83 Diagnostic Results Section is used, clarification is needed:
	- Are both procedure and result contained directly within section?
	- Does not specify how results are referenced from procedure.
	- Does not specify use of Result Organizer (as used in CCD Results Section)
	
* IHE ProcedureEntry (base of HITSP Procedure) is undefined in IHE PCC rev 5 and 6
	- template Id and name is mentioned, but never defined
	
* C83 Result
	- referenceRange is optional in C32, but SHOULD be present in CCD (CONF-419). 
		Cannot relax an inherited constraint.
