 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>Assessment And Plan Section</b></em>'.
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * <p>
 *     The Assessment and Plan Section contains information about the assessment of the patient's condition and
 *     expectations for care including proposals, goals, and order requests for monitoring, tracking, or improving the
 *     condition of the patient. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     An assessment and plan section varies from the plan of care section defined later in that it includes a
 *     physician assessment of the patient condition. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     <b>NOTE </b>:
 *     The assessments described in this section are physician assessments of the patient's current condition, and do not
 *     include assessments of functional status, or other assessments typically used in nursing. In Implementation Guides
 *     currently selected, when both the assessment and plan are documented, they are included together in a single section
 *     documenting both. When the physician assessment is not present, only the plan of care section appears. There are no
 *     cases where a physician assessment is provided without a plan.
