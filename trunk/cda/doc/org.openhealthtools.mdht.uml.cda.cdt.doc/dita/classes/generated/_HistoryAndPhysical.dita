In some situations, such as in the emergency department and pending surgery,
diagnostic findings are not available when a History and Physical is released. As
explained in Section 4.1 Section Descriptions above, a required section for which no

Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in
areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology,
microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens
obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory.
Imaging results are typically generated by a clinician reviewing the output of an imaging
procedure, such as where a cardiologist reports the left ventricular ejection fraction
based on the review of a cardiac echocardiogram.
Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician wanting to provide more
granular information about component observations made during the performance of a
procedure, such as where a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed
during a colonoscopy.</li></ul></li>
