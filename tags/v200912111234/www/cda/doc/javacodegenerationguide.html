<p>Now that we have explored the two diagrams associated with the
example template model, we will begin to look at how this model can be
used to generate a Java-based runtime implementation for producing,
consuming, and validating instances. The first step in the process is to
transform the template model into an implementation model. The
model-to-model transformation is invoked from an Ant build task. In
order to run the transformation, right-click on the build.xml file in
the project root directory and select Run as &gt; Ant Build</p>

<p>Make sure that Run in the same JRE as the workspace is selected
from the JRE tab. Then click the Apply button at the bottom of the
dialog and then Run. The console output should look something like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img  width=424 height=277 src="rsmimages/image011.jpg"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original template model is converted into an implementation
model with _Ecore.uml appended to the name. In this example, the
implementation model is named example_Ecore.uml. Constraints defined as
associations and property redefinitions in conjunction with metadata
specified in stereotype property values are transformed into OCL
constraints and annotations that are used for validation and instance
population at runtime. For example, the directed association
relationship that was defined between MyDocument and MySection gets
transformed into the following OCL constraint:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left: .5in'><span
	style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Courier New"'>self.getSection()-&gt;one(section
: cda::Section | section.oclIsKindOf(example::MySection))</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The getSection() method is an OCL query method that is defined
in the base CDA model to return all of the sections under a clinical
document by traversing the component.structuredBody.component
association between the ClinicalDocument and Section classes. The rest
of the constraint specifies that exactly one section is of type
MySection (or one of its subclasses).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second step in creating a Java runtime implementation is to
create the EMF model that will be used to generate Java source code. The
EMF model is provided for you in this example. The EMF model is composed
of two parts: the Ecore model and the generator model. The Ecore model
is very similar to the UML class model that was created during the
template modeling step. The generator model contains information about
how to transform the Ecore model into Java source code. As you can see
in the diagram below, the Ecore model is named example.ecore and the
generator model is named example.genmodel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img  width=222 height=90 src="rsmimages/image012.jpg"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order for changes to the template model to be reflected in
the EMF model after the model-to-model transformation, the EMF generator
model must be <i>reloaded</i>. In order to reload the generator model,
right click on example.genmodel and select Reload from the context
menu.  After the model import dialog pops up, click on the Next button
twice and then click on the Finish button. The new updated generator
model will display in editor view as shown:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img  width=185 height=153 src="rsmimages/image013.jpg"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third step is to right click on the root element named
Example and select Generate Model Code. This will generate all of the
required Java packages and source files under the src folder of the
project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img  width=275 height=139 src="rsmimages/image014.jpg"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can explore the generated code by browsing packages such as
org.openhealthtools.mdht.uml.cda.example under the src folder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img  width=297 height=138 src="rsmimages/image015.jpg"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will notice a Factory class is generated. This class is used
to create instances of the classes defined in your template model (e.g.
MyActivity) using the following syntax:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-left: .5in'><span
	style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Courier New"'>MyActivity
activity = ExampleFactory.eINSTANCE.createMyActivity().init();</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notice the init() method is called after the createMyActivity()
method. This is used to populate the instance with any fixed or default
values that were specified in the template model. This reduces the
number of method calls used to construct a valid instance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have provided a working test driver for this example in the
org.openhealthtools.mdht.uml.cda.example.tests package to demonstrate
the construction of a basic instance using classes from the template
model. Additionally, the driver demonstrates how to use the CDA utility
class to serialize and validate the document.</p>
