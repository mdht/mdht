Conformance rules not included
-------------------------------------------
CONF-7: CCD SHALL contain one or more ClinicalDocument / templateId.
 * this could never fail in MDHT implementation

 
Publishing TODO
-------------------------------------------
* Appendix of defined templates, sorted by ID (as table)
	- also referenced templates
* Appendix of sorted Conf Rule IDs, with hyperlink to defining class
* Appendix of referenced vocabulary
