		<p>TODO: Add acknowledgments specific to this project team.</p>
		<p>We acknowledge the foundational work on HL7 Version 3 and
			the Reference Information Model (RIM), the HL7 domain committees,
			especially Patient Care, and the work done on Clinical Document
			Architecture (CDA) itself.</p>
		<p>We also acknowledge the collaborative effort of the American
			Society for Standards and Materials (ASTM) and HL7, which produced
			the Continuity of Care Document (CCD). All these efforts were
			critical ingredients to the development of this Draft Standard for
			Trial Use (DSTU), and the degree to which the DSTU reflects these
			efforts will foster interoperability across the spectrum of health
			care.</p>
