     DITA OT release 1.4.3
     
     Release 1.4.3 is a maintenance release and is intended to be the last
     released based fully on DITA 1.1. It contains a significant amount of
     preview function for the upcoming DITA 1.2 standard, but the DITA 1.2
     document types must be specifically referenced in order to use this
     capability.
     
     The 1.4.3 release contains the following major updates:
     1.  The PDF codebase switched from the older deprecated code to the 
         plugin previously known as PDF2. Running a build with the transform
         type PDF or PDF2 will now run the new code. To continue using the
         older code, set your transform type to "legacypdf".
     2. The PDF plugin now runs with FOP, as well as with the latest version
        of Saxon.
     3. The Full Easy Install package now ships with Saxon 9B instead of
        with Xalan, and code in the DITA-OT package has been updated to work
        with Saxon 9B.
     4. The Full Easy Install package updates the versions of many open
        source libraries (including Ant and FOP)
     5. RFE 1982567 Allow spaces in DITA file names
     6. Preview function for the majority of the upcoming OASIS DITA 1.2
        standard, including everything from milestone builds one through
        twelve of DITA-OT 1.5

     DITA OT release 1.4
     Release 1.4 is a major release to add new functions, fulfill new 
     requirements, make some function enhancements and fix bugs over release 
     1.3.1. Available since August 1, 2007
     
     The DITA-OT Release 1.4 contains full support for the OASIS DITA 1.1 standard.
     This completes the preliminary support added in the 1.3 and 1.3.1 versions of
     the toolkit. New and improved items for 1.1 are listed under [Improvements]
     below. Support for the new bookmap standard is available in the latest version
     of the FO plug-in, which uses the "pdf2" transform type; it will be released
     together with or soon after the release of DITA-OT 1.4. The deprecated "pdf"
     transform type has not been updated for the new bookmap.

     Together with DITA 1.1 support, the toolkit development team has improved
     error reporting so that build failures are more accurately reported at the end
     of the build. Error handling will continue to improve in future releases.

     Release 1.4 comes in two versions. The full version contains several external
     packages that are useful or critical to running the toolkit, such as Xalan and
     the XML Catalog resolver. The smaller package contains only core toolkit code.

     NOTE ABOUT DEPRECATED CODE: changes for the new DITAVAL standard required
     a change to code in dita2htmlImpl.xsl. The "flagit" named template is deprecated
     and will not work with the new ditaval format. Overrides to this step should be
     updated to use "start-flagit" and "end-flagit". The flagit template will continue
     to work with the old ditaval but will generate a warning for each call.
     
     Changes:
       1. Release 1.4 improves the processing of DITA documents using XML Schemas. 
          One was able to process these type of documents in Release 1.3.1 but it 
          meant that the schema location had to have the ablsolute location of the 
          schema in order for the Toolkit properly.  
          
          DITA 1.1 introduces the use of URNs to normatively identify the schemas 
          used for validation.  The URNs have the following desing pattern
          "urn:oasis:names:tc:dita:xsd:<schemaDocument>:1.1". You should use these in 
          as the value for the attribute xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation.

     [13 Improvements]
       1.  Support <title> in map 
       2.  Ignore Index-base in default processing 
       3.  Support for index-see and index-see-also 
       4.  Retrieve the link text from abstract element. 
       5.  Format shortdesc in abstract appropriately
       6.  Add standard code to allow overrides to easily process generalized version of unknown and foreign element 
       7.  Support @dir on every element
       8.  Refactor mapref resolution 
       9.  Support generalization and re-specialization of unknown/foreign elements 
       10. Replace Move Index module with new Move Metadata module 
       11. New DITAVAL standard support 
       12. New chunk attribute support 
       13. Support XML Schema validated instance document processing using XML Catalogs

     DITA OT release 1.3

     Release 1.3 is a major release to add new functions, fulfill new 
     requirements, make some function enhancements and fix bugs over release 
     1.2.2. Available since September 28, 2006

     OASIS DITA 1.1 support

     Things to know about OASIS DITA 1.1 support in this release:

       1.DITA-OT 1.3 provides preliminary processing support for the upcoming 
          OASIS DITA 1.1 specification (see 
          http://wiki.oasis-open.org/dita/Roadmap_for_DITA_development). 
          Because the proposed OASIS DITA 1.1 DTDs and Schemas are fully 
          backwards compatible with the latest DITA 1.0.1 DTDs and Schemas, the
          1.3 Toolkit provides the proposed 1.1 materials as the default DTDs 
          for processing. The XML Catalog resolution maps any references for 
          DITA 1.0 doctypes to the 1.1 DTDs, for example. All processing 
          ordinarily dependent on the 1.0 definition continues to work as 
          usual, and any documents that make use of the newer 1.1-based 
          elements or attributes will be supported with specific new processing
          function (such as base support for the new <data> element). Documents 
          created with the proposed OASIS DITA 1.1 DTDs are the only ones ever 
          likely to have features that invoke the specific new 1.1-based 
          processing support.
          Important: Because this support is based on a yet-to-be-approved 
          version of the proposed OASIS DITA 1.1 specification, if you choose 
          to investigate any1.1-based function, be aware that the 1.1 
          implementation in this version of the Toolkit is preliminary and very
          much forward-looking. Upon final approval of the DITA 1.1 standard, 
          Toolkit developers will, of course, review our implementation to make
          certain that it conforms to the defined level of reference 
          implementation.
       2.Related to the DITA 1.1 preliminary implementation, the 
          much-discussed bookmap updates for DITA 1.1 will be provided as 
          override capabilities for the FO plugin (Idiom's donation). Note 
          that:
              The FO demo transform code at the 1.2.2 level is still included 
              in the DITA 1.3 package, but is now deprecated.
              To get the FO updates for 1.3, grab the FO plug-in at its next 
              update, which should be shortly after the 1.3 core Toolkit code 
              is released. 
              The updated FO plug-in will be usable with FOP as well as with 
              XEP. 

     Changes

     The DITA Open Toolkit team understands the need for stability in 
     essential APIs in the Toolit. This verson of the toolkit provides some 
     strategic updates that correct some long-overdue faults in the original 
     implementation. Necessarily, there are some changes to note: 

       1.Change to build.xml: To make the DITA processing environment more 
          like other Ant-driven build environments, the original build.xml has 
          been renamed as build_demo.xml. The current build.xml in this release
          is now the normal ANT script entrance for starting a transformation. 
          If you have created Ant tasks that tried to work around the former 
          build.xml architecture, those might need to be revised to take 
          advantage of the separated function.
       2.Change to command line invocations: The "Ant refactoring" exercise 
          for this release has changed some previously documented Ant calls for
          running demos. This change enables better use of the Ant modules for 
          power users who need to integrate the Toolkit into programming build 
          environments such as Eclipse, but the change affects some 
          documentation. This is a permanent change that should remain stable 
          from now on. Wherever you see an older instruction like 
          "c:\dita-ot>ant all", you now need to indicate the component that 
          contains the demos, so you would type "c:\dita-ot>ant all -f 
          build_demo.xml". 
       3.Separation of demo targets from formal component targets: Another 
          effect of the Ant refactoring is that the internal programming 
          targets will now be displayed when you type "ant -p". To see both 
          those programmings targets and the demos that are part of this 
          component, type "c:\dita-ot>ant -p -f build_demo.xml". To run just 
          one of the demos that you see in the resulting list, dita.faq for 
          example, type "c:\dita-ot>ant dita.faq -f build_demo.xml". 
       4.Classpath update to enable catalog resolver: This release now 
          includes the Apache catalog resolver for improved lookup of DTDs by 
          any of the Toolkit components. The fullpackage version of the Toolkit
          sets up these variables for each session. For the regular (smaller) 
          version of the Toolkit, you need to include lib and 
          lib\resource\resolver.jar into your classpath. For example if your 
          CLASSPATH is like: 

          c:\dita-ot\lib\dost.jar

          you need to change it to: 

          c:\dita-ot\lib;c:\dita-ot\lib\dost.jar;c:\dita-ot\lib\resolver.jar

          At any time, the full version can be used like a normal installation 
          as long as you update the system variables either in the evironment 
          settings or in a batch file that sets up the shell environment. 

       5.License bundling: To reduce the duplication of builds on Sourceforge 
          in which the only difference was the license provided in each, both 
          the Apache and CPL licenses are included in root directory of the 
          Toolkit. Use the one that applies to your situation.
       6.Two install options: Two download versions are now offered. The 
          smaller one is for updating existing installations or for reuse in 
          embedded applications that already provide the other processing 
          components--business as usual. A new package with "fullpackage" in 
          the name now incorporates the essential processing modules to create 
          a processing environment for new users and evaluators that requires 
          nothing more than to unzip the file into an appropriate directory and
          then click on a "start" batch file. A new document in its root 
          directory (an output of doc/EvaluateOT.dita, "Evaluating the DITA 
          Open Toolkit (fullpackage version)") informs new users how to install
          and use the Toolkit for the first time.
       7.Other enhancements: The public design discussions that fed into the 
          final selection and architectures for this release are documented at 
          the DITA Focus Area in a topic called "DITA OT 1.3 Issues tracking"
          (http://dita.xml.org/node/1282).

DITA OT release 1.2
Available since Feb. 23, 2006

DITA open toolkit Release 1.2 is a major release to add new functions, fulfill new requirements, make some function enhancements and fix bugs over release 1.1.2.1.

DITA-OT 1.2 Important Change
DITA-OT 1.2 offers new error handling and logging system. If you invoke your transformation by using java command line where new error handling and logging system is mandatory, you need to set the CLASSPATH Environment Variable to include dost.jar. If you invoke your transformation by using an ant script, you need to do one more step after the setting above. That is adding a parameter in your command to invoke an ant script. For example, use ant -f ant\sample_xhtml.xml -logger org.dita.dost.log.DITAOTBuildLogger instead of ant -f ant\sample_xhtml.xml to start a transformation defined in ant script file ant\sample_xhtml.xml.

[7 Function Enhancements]
1. New plugin archiecture
2. Transformation to wordrtf
3. HTML to DITA migration tool
4. Problem determination and log analysis
5. Open DITA User Guide for conditional processing
6. Include the OASIS version langref
7. Document adapt to OASIS DITA 1.0.1 DTDs

[10 SF Bugs Fixed]
1.  SF Bug 1304545 Some folders were copied to DITA-OT's root directory
2.  SF Bug 1328689 Stylesheet links in HTML emitted with local filesystem paths
3.  SF Bug 1333481 Mapref function does not work for maps in another directory
4.  SF Bug 1343963 Blank index.html generated for ditamap contains only reltabe
5.  SF Bug 1344486 java.io.EOFException thrown out when reading ditaval file
6.  SF Bug 1347669 Path Spec. in nested DITA maps
7.  SF Bug 1357139 filtering behavior doesn't conform to spec
8.  SF Bug 1358619 The property.temp file gets cleaned out by default
9.  SF Bug 1366843 XRefs do not generate proper links in FO/PDF
10. SF Bug 1367636 dita2fo-elems.xsl has strange line breaks


[9 SF RFEs Added]

DITA OT release 1.1.2.1
Available since Nov. 10, 2005

Release 1.1.2.1 is a full build to provide an urgent fix to fix the following critical problem which users found in release 1.1.2.
1. SF Bug 1345600  The build process failed when run "Ant all" in release 1.1.2

For this fix, we have restored all the source DITA files in 'doc' and directories in the binary packages.

Note that the original parameter "args.eclipse.toc" in "Ant tasks and script" was separated to "args.eclipsehelp.toc" for DITA-to-Eclipse help transformation, and "args.eclipsecontent.toc" for DITA-to-dynamic Eclipse content transformation.

Another issue is that we found there is a mismatch in the document and the toolkit behavior when you are trying to use the following command 
   ant -f conductor.xml -propertyfile ${dita.temp.dir}/property.temp. 
Now we have updated the documentation. Please refer to the topic 'Building DITA output with Java command line' on our website for more details.

These updates do not affect standard operation of the toolkit. The main goal of this minor release to enable new users of the toolkit to run the installation verification tests without failure.

DITA Open Toolkit 1.0 is a major upgrade from its predecessor, the developerWorks version known as "dita132." Because this is a new project with a new name. a new home, and largely new code, and because it is considered production-level code for XHTML output, the project numbering has been initiated at 1.0 for the first built release. The 1.0 version of code is still based on the dita132 DTDs and Schemas.

Major improvements from dita132 include:

    * A new processing architecture that includes a new preprocessing stage
    * Full conref resolution in the preprocessor
    * Full conditional resolution (filtering and flagging) in the preprocessor
    * Second pass transformation into final output formats
    * Use of Ant and Java for the processing sequence and utility code
    * A high-quality transform for XHTML output based on code that IBM has tested and used for the past 5 years
    * Translated libraries for generated text in 47 languages (accessed by region and country code)
