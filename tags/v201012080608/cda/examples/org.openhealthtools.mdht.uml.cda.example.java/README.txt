
This example shows how to create a new CDA template model programmatically.

*** IMPORTANT:
Prior to running, you must set several file path constants in CreateModel.java 
for your computer configuration.

Then, right-click on Main.java and Run As > Java Application

The new MyCDA.uml model is saved in your user home directory.  If you want to open this
model in Rational Software Modeler, rename to MyCDA.emx and copy into a project within
your workspace where the CDA Tools are installed.  Open as usual.
