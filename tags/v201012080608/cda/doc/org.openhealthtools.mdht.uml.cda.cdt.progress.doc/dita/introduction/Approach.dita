	<title>Approach</title>
	<body>
		<p>In the development of this specification, we reviewed existing
			draft and final specifications or implementation guides for similar
			artifacts in the U.S.:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Clinical LOINC&#174; document and section codes</li>
			<li>HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, Release 2 Normative Web
				Edition, 2005</li>
			<li>CDA Release 2 â€“ CCD: Continuity of Care Document (CCD)</li>
			<li>HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA Release 2: History and
				Physical (H&amp;P) Notes</li>
			<li>HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA Release 2: Care Record
				Summary</li>
			<li>HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA Release 2: Procedure Note</li>
			<li>Non-CDA sample documents supplied by participating providers
				and vendors</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition, M*Modal provided statistical analysis of
			approximately 25,000 sample Progress Notes. The HL7 Structured Documents
			Work Group reviewed the design. While current divergent industry
			practices cannot be perfectly reflected in any consensus model, we
			designed this specification to increase consistency with minimal
			disruption to current practice and workflow.</p>
