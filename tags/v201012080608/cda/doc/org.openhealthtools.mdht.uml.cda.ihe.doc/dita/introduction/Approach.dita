		<p>Working with an initial portion of the data provides the
			opportunity to work with the data from the perspective of the
			underlying model and electronic format and to explore many design
			issues thoroughly. Taking this as an initial step ensures that the
			data set developers and standards community can reach consensus prior
			to the larger commitment of time that would be required to bring the
			full data set into standard format.</p>
		<p>This project supports reusability and ease of data collection
			through a standard data representation harmonized with work developed
			through Health Information Technology Expert Panel (HITEP), balloted
			through Health Level Seven (HL7) and/or recognized by the Health
			Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP).</p>
		<p>This implementation guide (IG) specifies a standard for electronic
			submission of NCRs in a Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), Release
			2 format.</p>
