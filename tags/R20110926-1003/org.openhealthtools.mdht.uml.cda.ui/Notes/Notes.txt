shortname = lowercase of model file name without extension

basePackage = org.openhealthtools.mdht.uml.cda.shortname
nsPrefix = shortname
nsURI = http://www.openhealthtools.org/mdht/uml/cda/shortname
packageName = shortname
prefix = capitalized shortname
first time CodegenSupport is applied UI tab fills this in these defaults
if no Codegen is specified
then this happens in model to model (as you do now but for all attributes not just nsURI)

actual prefix can be original model file name with first letter capitalized that way 
if the model file name is all caps the prefix will remain call caps (some might like this)
